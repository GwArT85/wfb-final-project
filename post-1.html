        <p class="wrapper-2">NFL Street is my all time favorite football game. When you are yards ahead of your opposition you can use style moves to show off. Be careful though, as this makes you more susceptible to a fumble. You get to customize custom and NFL Players in everyday clothes. Do-rags and baseball caps take the place of helmets, as there are hardly any regulations to this game of Street Football. Overall, I'd give this game a 9.5/10, as I would say that this is a nearly perfect game, but it shows its age in the graphics and celebrations.
